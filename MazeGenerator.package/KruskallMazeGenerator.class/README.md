I am a maze generator, I generate mazes according to Kruskall algorithm.

In the Kruskal's algorithm for maze generation, the categories represent disjoint sets of cells. Initially, each cell is its own category, and as the algorithm progresses, these categories (sets of cells) are merged together until there is only one category left, representing the entire maze.

At the beginning of the algorithm, each cell is in its own category. As the algorithm selects edges and considers merging categories, the number of categories decreases. The algorithm continues until there is only one category, at which point the maze is fully connected.

The number of categories initially is equal to the total number of cells in the maze. As the algorithm progresses, the number of categories decreases as cells are merged. The goal is to connect all cells in the maze by removing walls (represented by edges between cells) in a way that doesn't create cycles.

The categories essentially represent disjoint sets of cells that are not yet connected in the maze. As the algorithm proceeds and merges categories, it establishes connections between these sets until there is a single connected set representing the entire maze.

initCategories: this method takes the coordinates of a cell (i and j), retrieves the cell from the grid, creates a new category containing only that cell, and then associates the cell with its category number in catIndex and adds the category to the categories dictionary. This process is part of the initialization phase where each cell is initially assigned to its own unique category.
